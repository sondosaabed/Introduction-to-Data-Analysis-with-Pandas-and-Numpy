    "\n",
    "Two common ways to view the data types for a DataFrame are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dtypes attribute, which gives you Series with the name of each column and its data type\n",
    "- The familiar .info() method. This gives you extra information, not just the data types, but can be useful if you're having trouble remembering all of the attributes and methods\n",

    "### Converting data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting data types usually involves the .astype() method. There are two main ways to use this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Casting using dictionary mapping. For example, df['column_A'] = df.astype({'column_A': 'int32'})\n",
    "- Casting using series. For example, df['column_A'] = df['column_A'].astype('int32')"
